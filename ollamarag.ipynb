       " 'documents': [[\" Hi, I'm Peter Adamson and you're listening to the History of Philosophy podcast, brought to you with the support of the LMU in Munich, online at www.historyoffilosophy.net. Today's episode, A Matter of Taste, Ibn Arabi and Mysticism. Never let it be said that an obsession with Aristotle prevents you from getting out and meeting people. Take a Verruise. There are not one, but two famous stories about his encounters with contemporaries. We've already heard the one about his audience with the Almohad emir. Here's the other one. Averruise has heard tell of a young man who received revelatory insight while engaged in a spiritual retreat. He is eager to meet the youth and upon seeing him gives him a warm embrace. Yes, says Averruise, and the youth replies, yes. So far the discussion is going very positively, so Averruise smiles. But the youth now says, no. Averruise is now troubled and asks the young man about his revelatory experience. Has it taught him the same things that one can learn through reason? Yes and no, replies the youth, apparently figuring that this approach has worked well in the conversation so far. But then he adds, between the yes and the no, spirits fly from their matter and heads from their bodies. Averruise is impressed. Like Ibn Tufayl's fictional character, Hayy ibn Yaqdan, the young man has achieved wisdom without having to study Aristotle or any other books. Averruise can only give thanks to God that he was given a chance to meet this extraordinary individual. The youth's name? Muhiyad-din Muhammad ibn Ali ibn al-Arabi. Averruise was right in his glowing assessment. Ibn Arabi will be honored with the title Ashaykh al-Aqbar, or greatest master, and recognized as the towering genius of the Islamic mystical tradition known as Sufism. The story is obviously more flattering to Ibn Arabi and puts Averruise's hard-won rational scholarship at a distinctively lower level than Ibn Arabi's mystical vision. So you may not be surprised to hear that it is not Averruise, but Ibn Arabi himself who relates the anecdote. Here he is looking back on his younger days in his homeland of Andalusia. He was born in the year 1165 in Mursia, and like Averruise, belonged to a fairly eminent family. He encountered Averruise after his spiritual enlightenment, but before he left Andalusia to go east at the age of 30. He went on the Hajj, or pilgrimage, to Mecca and never came back, eventually taking up residence as a Sufi master in Damascus. Was he a philosopher? As Ibn Arabi himself might say, yes and no. His writings are packed with technical terms borrowed from the philosophical tradition. He also uses vivid imagery to represent concepts familiar to us from philosophers, especially Avicenna. Yet it would be reductive and misleading to see Ibn Arabi as an Avicennan philosopher with an unusual flair for metaphor. As the story of the meeting with Averruise shows, he himself thought that the rational methods of philosophy are limited in what they can achieve. He seeks not the well-grounded, logically valid demonstrations extolled by Avicenna or Averruise, but rather truths that would seem like mere contradictions to such plodding purveyors of rational proof. One might more plausibly say that Ibn Arabi should be credited with bringing philosophy into the Sufi tradition. As I've just mentioned, he does show mastery of philosophical ideas and use them for his own purposes. But it would again be misleading to see him as the first philosophical Sufi. For one thing, he does not yet present Sufism as an explicit philosophical system. That will be left to his followers and especially his stepson and commentator al-Qunawi, who we'll meet in a later episode. For another thing, philosophy influenced Sufism before Ibn Arabi came along. Bear in mind we're in the 12th century here, and Sufism has had a long time to develop by this point in history. The word Sufi derives from the Arabic word suf, meaning wool, a reference to the rough garments worn by these mystics. This tells us something about the outward appearance and behavior of the Sufis. Like the late antique church fathers and mothers, and like the cynics, they were ascetics. Also like the desert fathers and mothers, the Sufis were the subject of an extensive body of literature, with anecdotes highlighting this ascetic impulse as well as their piety and intimate relationship with God, and their indictment of the hypocrisy of fellow Muslims. Here's one anecdote I particularly like, that illustrates not only the asceticism of Sufis, but also the one-upmanship that often features in this literary genre. A Sufi from Khorasan tells a Sufi from Iraq how abstemious he and his colleagues are. If God provides them with food, they give thanks, but if not, they go hungry without complaint. The other Sufi says this sort of thing is known in his land of Iraq too. It's what dogs do there. As for the Iraqi Sufis, when God sends them food, they give it away to the needy, and when he doesn't, they give thanks. And here's another story, which could easily have been a story about an ancient cynic philosopher. A prince is told that a man has been climbing around on the roof of his palace. The prince has the man brought before him and demands to know what he was doing up there. Looking for my lost camel, says the man. The prince laughs, but the man replies that the prince is engaged in an equally absurd task by trying to live a pious life while surrounded by wealth and luxury. The prince repents and becomes an ascetic. Perhaps it is not a coincidence that all three of these ascetic movements—cynicism, antique Christianity, and Sufism—have included women in the ranks of their greatest sages. The cynics had hyparchia, the Christians heroines like Makrina and Melania, and the Sufis have Rabia al-Adawiya. Alive already in the 8th century, she was among the earliest important, Muslim mystics. She introduced into Sufism the central theme of love and erotic longing for God. We have no surviving writings by Rabia, but some lines of verse are ascribed to her and she is a favorite protagonist in later Sufi literature. In one such literary portrayal, she says that the lover seeks a togetherness with the beloved so intense that nothing separates the two. Someone who consummates such an erotic relationship with God has experienced something that cannot be expressed in language. It is like taste in Arabic dhawq, which is a standard Sufi term for direct contact with God. Other stories tell of how she was oblivious to the beauty of the world around her because of her exclusive love for God. She remarked that, This theme of passionate love in Arabic ishq will play a role in the writings of later Sufis, including the great Persian poet Arumi. It is also prominent in the most famous of the early Sufis, the mystic martyr Al-Halaaj, whose name actually means someone who cards wool. I'm not exactly sure what carding wool is, to be honest. Maybe some kind of sheep-related gambling. Al-Halaaj led an eventful life, traveling from his home in the Persian province of Fars, to travel widely, including in India, where Sufism would blossom in centuries to come. But he is better known for the grotesque manner of his death in the year 922. After he set himself up as a religious teacher in Baghdad, he ran afoul of the authorities, making a particular enemy of the vizier Hamid, who served the Abbasid caliph al-Mukhtadir. At the vizier's instigation, Al-Halaaj was imprisoned and, according to one account, This spectacularly brutal murder was perhaps motivated more by political considerations than doctrinal ones. But certainly, Al-Halaaj could shock fellow Muslims with his teachings. He is most famous for a remark he made to his more moderate teacher, Al-Junaid. When he knocked on his master's door, Al-Junaid asked who was there, and Al-Halaaj called out, Since Al-Haq, the Truth, or the Real, is one of God's revealed names, this was a rather shocking remark, and one that the master Al-Junaid repudiated. Another major figure of the earlier Sufi tradition was Abu Sa'id ibn Abi al-Khayr. He played a major role in the social institutions of Sufism, introducing a set of rules to be followed by members of Sufi orders and also the idea of listening to music during Sufi gatherings. This tradition of samāh, or listening, is connected to the famous dance of the whirling dervishes. We know from a previous episode that the enjoyment of music was controversial for pious Muslims, so it was bold of Abu Sa'id to associate music and dance with the asceticism of the Sufis. In fact, it was something Ibn Arabi didn't like one bit. In a kind of foreshadowing of the anecdote that brings together Avarwis and Ibn Arabi, no less a philosopher than Avicenna supposedly made a visit to meet Abu Sa'id. The two got on famously, and after he departed, Avicenna was asked what he made of Abu Sa'id. He answered simply, Everything I know, he sees. Meanwhile, Abu Sa'id's students similarly wanted to know what he thought of Avicenna. His reply? Everything I see, he knows. These earlier figures give us a taste, if you'll pardon the expression, of the richness of, and perhaps the contradictions within, Sufism up to the time of Ibn Arabi. These men and women were recognized as sages, admired for their total devotion to God and renunciation of the things of this world. They often received support from the society around them, especially under the Seljuks, when they were sponsored by the famous vizier Nizam al-Mulk, patron of the Nidamiya schools we discussed in the first episode on Al-Ghazali. Yet, the theology of the Sufis could also provoke hostility, even if it remained largely implicit. Most problematic was the suggestion that the Sufis themselves had attained some kind of divinity. This would be one possible interpretation of Al-Halaaj's statement, I am the truth. He was claiming to be identical with God. In fact, we might even take the Sufis to be teaching that the whole created universe is nothing but God. For, they often describe the universe, with all its variety and multiplicity, as an illusion, or veil, concealing an underlying divine unity, which alone is real. Is this the teaching we find in the much more elaborate and sophisticated works of Ibn Arabi? The answer is inevitable, yes and no. He frequently speaks of God as al-haq, the truth or the real, and does present the created universe as a veil that conceals God. On the other hand, the universe is also a manifestation of God. It is the form in which God shows himself. This sort of idea had occasionally been proposed in antiquity, especially by the anonymous Christian Neoplatonist who called himself Dionysius. But Ibn Arabi's works are unprecedented in the detail with which they present this idea. His writings attempt to hold two apparently contradictory ideas in a kind of dialectical tension. On the one hand, being or reality consists of nothing but God, who is utterly one. On the other hand, this single divine reality shows itself forth as a multiplicity of things that are, in their own way, real. As I say, Ibn Arabi was not the first to use philosophical materials in the service of mystical theory. Just think about Ghazali, who apparently saw Sufism as a higher path of understanding than philosophy. But if we're judging by sheer quantity, no one can compete with Ibn Arabi. His most ambitious and massive work, the Meccan Revelations, has received a modern edition which managed to cover only about a quarter of its chapters in about a dozen volumes. So, you'll understand that I only had time to read his works cover to cover twice in preparing this episode. It wasn't really Ibn Arabi's fault that he wrote so much. He was just setting down in writing what had been directly revealed to him from a divine source. In the preface to his most frequently read treatise entitled Ringstones of Wisdom, he explains that the work we are about to read was delivered to him in a dream by none other than the Prophet Muhammad. Ibn Arabi's stories of religious revelation constituted a powerful claim to authority, and one that was rather successful. Much as philosophy in the later Eastern tradition will frequently take the form of commentary on Avicenna, so philosophical Sufism will often be presented as commentary on Ibn Arabi. His Ringstones of Wisdom, far briefer than the gargantuan Meccan Revelations, has been the subject of hundreds of commentaries, stretching right down to the 20th century. The Ringstones of Wisdom consists of 27 chapters, each of which discusses a prophet recognized by Islam. The idea of the title is that every prophet is like a different setting on a ring into which the jewel of God's word is set. This explains why the different prophets bring superficially different messages, despite receiving their prophecy from the same source. The book begins with Adam, yes that Adam of Adam and Eve fame, and explains how God created mankind in order to see himself in this image. Of course, the last chapter concerns Muhammad, the seal of the prophets. Ibn Arabi's scripturally based method is closely related to his philosophical stance. The core of his teaching is that God is, in himself or in his essence, unknowable to us. We grasp him only insofar as he shows himself to us. This is why the application of pure reason, according to Ibn Arabi, tends inevitably towards a kind of emptiness, in which philosophers discover that God eludes all language and thought. Ultimately, this tendency leads to tanzi, meaning the denial of God's attributes because of his absolute transcendence. Equally, though, Ibn Arabi rejects a tendency he finds in some theologians, known as tashbih, to assimilate or compare God's nature to what God has created. Again, Ibn Arabi wants to strike a balance between yes and no, negotiating between the naive positive language of tashbih and the blank negation of tanzi. This is possible only because God has revealed himself. So, we must begin from the texts containing that revelation. Ibn Arabi is particularly glad to find verses in the Qur'an like this. There is nothing like unto him and he is the seeing, the hearing. In this single sentence, we have an apparent case of tanzi, there is nothing like God, and then an apparent case of tashbih, God is hearing and seeing, like you and me. Ibn Arabi's favorite way to explore, if not resolve, these tensions is to consider the divine names. In fact, God's names are infinite, but only a finite number have been revealed to us. It is by these names, and these names alone, that we can speak of God. This, by itself, is not a particularly bold or unusual idea, but in Ibn Arabi's hands it becomes a more radical notion, because he sees the created universe itself as nothing more nor less than the interplay between the divine names. Each name marks a certain relationship between God and the world he has created. For instance, he is said to be merciful because he shows mercy towards his creatures. There are many names because God relates to creatures in a variety of different ways. This strikes me as a very interesting answer to a long-standing philosophical problem, familiar especially from antique thinkers like Plotinus, Proclus, the Cappadocians, and the Pseudo-Dionysius. All these thinkers wanted to say that God, or the first principle, gives rise to the universe, but also that he transcends this universe. Various analogies had been proposed as models of the relationship between God and creation. Usually, the analogies involved relations of cause and effect. God is like a light shining forth rays, a mind giving rise to ideas, and so on. Ibn Arabi's brilliant, and deeply Quranic, idea is instead to think of this relationship as that between a thing and its names. This suggestion has many virtues. It helps to explain how a God who is purely one can give rise to a multiplicity. The most fundamental of puzzles in the Neoplatonic tradition can now be solved, since it is easy for us to understand that a single thing might have many names while itself remaining one. The names can even be in apparent tension with one another, because God can bear apparently contradictory relations to things in the universe. Ibn Arabi goes out of his way to emphasize this dwelling on opposed names like the merciful and the vengeful. In God himself, there is no opposition or multiplicity, yet we find conflict and variety in the way that he shows himself, which is to say in his names. Another advantage is that names have a rather ambiguous metaphysical status. Ibn Arabi's handling of this issue is sophisticated. He distinguishes carefully between three levels. There is the meaning, or bearer, of the name, in this case God, then the name itself, and only then is a third item the linguistic expression which we actually utter. He calls this linguistic manifestation the name of the name, and compares it to a cloak covering the name of God. All this nicely captures the situation we find ourselves in relative to God. We usually only see an outward surface appearance of God's self-manifestation. When we remove this first veil, we come to God's names, which are the ways in which God has shown himself the ways he relates to his creation. But even here, we have not arrived at full-blown reality or being. This would be God himself, which is why one of his names is al-Haq, the truth. Rather, we are here in the realm of yes and no, a kind of compromise between reality and illusion, between existence and non-existence. This is as real as created things can get, since they are only a manifestation or representation of what is really real, namely God. Ibn Arabi has several ways of articulating this idea. One is borrowed from Avicenna. In the Avicenna idea of a contingent thing that exists by being necessary through another, Ibn Arabi sees an example of the kind of halfway house he is looking for, between genuine being and total non-being. With characteristically beautiful imagery, he talks of non-existent things as suffering from a kind of restriction or constraint, and then finding relief as God breathes them out into their state of dependent existence. He refers to this process with a phrase taken from prophetic hadith, the breath of the merciful. Because of the ambiguous and even self-contradictory status of created existence, Ibn Arabi thinks it can best be grasped not by philosophical reason, but by what he calls imagination. This is something we access most frequently through dreams, whose conjuring of impossible images gives us a better insight into created reality than any Aristotelian syllogism. Consistently with this, when Ibn Arabi comes to consider specific philosophical problems, he often seems to revel in paradox, especially if he can ground the paradox in Scripture. A nice example is what he has to say about human action. Ibn Arabi instead draws our attention to an episode in the life of the prophet, when the tide of a battle turned after Muhammad symbolically threw a handful of sand towards the enemy. Subsequently, it was revealed to him, You threw not when you threw, but it was God who threw, that he might test the believers. An Asharite would embrace this Quranic verse as proof that God was really the one who performed the action of throwing. Ibn Arabi instead points out that the verse still says to Muhammad, when you threw. In other words, Muhammad did throw the sand, but only because God threw it. As always, created things are nothing but a manifestation of divine truth and reality. There's a widespread perception, I think, that philosophy in the later Islamic tradition becomes entirely suffused by mysticism. Rational argument is set aside in favor of a direct vision or taste of God, which cannot be put into words. Some welcome this development, ascribing to Ibn Arabi and his heirs the discovery of insights deeper than anything rationalist philosophy can offer. Others lament the slide of Islamic intellectual traditions into paradox-mongering and obfuscation. In fact, though, things were more complex. As we've just seen, Ibn Arabi does see philosophy as fundamentally limited, yet he weaves it into mystical Islam. Also, though his historical influence is enormous, it is not as if Sufism and later Islamic philosophy are just identical. Sufism will be a major player in the later development of philosophy, but the same is true of Asharite Kalam and Avicenna. So, whether you like mysticism or loathe it, later philosophy in the eastern lands of Islam will have something to offer you. We're not ready to look at it yet, though. Soon we'll be turning to the Jewish contribution to philosophy in Andalusia, something that will take us a number of episodes to cover. And before that, we have one last Muslim from the West to consider. What I've just been saying illustrates his thought rather well, as it happens, that to understand history we need to attend to interacting forces that are always more complex than they first may seem. Should you join me again next time? The answer is not an Ibn Arabi-style yes and no, but the one given by Molly Bloom at the end of James Joyce's Ulysses, Yes, yes, yes, yes. Because our subject will be a man with some claim to be the greatest of all pre-modern historians, Ibn Khaldun. Here on The History of Philosophy, without any caps. .\",\n",
       "   ' Hi, I\\'m Peter Adamson and you\\'re listening to the History of Philosophy podcast, brought to you with the support of King\\'s College London and the Lieberman Trust. Online at www.historyoffilosophy.net. Today\\'s episode, Balancing Acts, Arabic Ethical Literature. Next to the room where I am recording this, there is a bathroom in which you can currently see a bar of soap still in its wrapping. The label promises that this soap can help to re-establish the balance between the mind and the body. Amazingly, it was only slightly more expensive than normal soap, which limits itself to helping you wash your hands. And we\\'re fortunate to live in a day and age when one can not only get soap for one\\'s mind but also chicken soup for one\\'s soul, as in the title of a line of popular self-help manuals. This sort of thing hasn\\'t been possible since the Abbasid Empire. During the formative period of philosophy in the Islamic world, we find several authors writing their own popular self-help manuals with titles like On Dispelling Sadness, Benefits for Bodies and Souls, Refinement of Character, and most tellingly of all, Spiritual Medicine. That last one is the title of a work by Abu Bakr al-Razi, inventor of the widely deplored Theory of Five Eternals. You may recall that the works in which he set forth that theory no longer survive, perhaps because they were too controversial for anyone to want to copy them. The same cannot be said for the Spiritual Medicine, which on a casual reading seems like a rather harmless, if rather hectoring, collection of ethical advice. It was written as a partner piece to one of al-Razi\\'s large medical treatises, the Book for al-Mansur, who was the patron to whom both texts were dedicated. The Book for al-Mansur tells you everything you need to know to have a healthy body. And the Spiritual Medicine completes the job by telling you how to have a healthy soul. To some extent this may seem familiar. Not only do we buy books called things like Chicken Soup for the Soul, but we routinely talk about mental or psychological health. What is less familiar, though, is the idea that ethics itself might be a kind of medicine. Here al-Razi is looking back to his chief influence from the Greek tradition, who was neither Plato nor Aristotle, but Galen. The greatest of ancient doctors, Galen wrote voluminously on every area of his art, creating a body of work that would underlie medical literature for many centuries, something we heard about in the interview with Peter Poorman. Galen also wrote about an idea that was prevalent in the ancient world, that the soul, like the body, can be ill or healthy. We find it, for instance, in Epicureanism, with its fourfold remedy of ethical advice. In Galen, ethical advice is part of what a skilled physician is able to offer his patient. Indeed, there can be no sharp divide between caring for the body and caring for the soul. As he argues in a work with the self-explanatory title, The States of the Soul Depend on the Mixtures of the Body, the effects of alcohol on people who drink is a particularly clear example of the way the body can affect even the rational part of the soul. Because of this intimate relation between body and soul, doctors can actually modify a person\\'s ethical character by prescribing certain diets. The goal of Galenic ethics is not just, as my bar of soap would have it, establishing a balance between mind and body. It is also a matter of achieving balance within the soul, much as the doctor tries to balance the four humours in the body. As an admirer of Plato, Galen adopted the theory we find in dialogues like The Republic and Timaeus, according to which every person\\'s soul has three aspects—reason, spirit, and desire. Ethically speaking, health consists in the appropriate interrelation of these three parts. Reason should dominate desire, with the assistance of the righteous indignation provided by spirit. Psychological disorders happen when the lower soul is out of control. For instance, when one is particularly prone to anger because of a strong-spirited part of the soul, something Galen admits affected his own mother. Libertines and gluttons, similarly, allow their desire to dominate their reason. Galen speaks at length about these failings of character in two ethical works that were known in the Arabic tradition. In fact, one, called On Character Traits, is lost in Greek but survives in Arabic. Darazi alludes to Galen\\'s ideas with the very title spiritual medicine, and in the text itself he exploits and expands on the Galenic program of psychological medicine. He begins by telling us that God\\'s greatest gift to mankind is akhl, meaning intellect or reason. It is in virtue of reason that we differ from non-human animals, as we can observe from the fact that they plunge headlong after pleasures, such as food or sex, without bothering to consider the consequences of what they are doing. On the other hand, animals naturally limit their pursuit of pleasure. For instance, they will stop eating once they are no longer hungry. By contrast, there are many humans who can never fulfill their immoderate desires. As Arazi says, offered power over half the world, many would still want to conquer the other half. From his own experience, Arazi tells the story of eating dates with a glutton who stuffed himself to bursting and then lamented that he could not go back to the beginning and start eating all over again. Arazi chastised him, pointing out that the pain caused by overeating was bound to outweigh the pleasure of the food. Remarks like that have led some to see Arazi as a kind of sophisticated hedonist along the lines of Epicurus, advising us to plan ahead to maximize our pleasures rather than heedlessly grabbing every pleasure that comes along. But in fact, Arazi was no hedonist at all. He accepted Plato\\'s analysis of pleasure as resulting from the restoration of the body to its natural state, out of a state of deficiency. For instance, when you drink, it is pleasant because you are remedying the dryness of your body. Thus, pleasure is only possible because of the harmful states you are trying to remedy. So serious was he about this, that he supposedly offered the following explanation of what happens when you enjoy seeing a beautiful face, it\\'s because you\\'ve been hanging around with ugly people and are yearning for a change. The good life though, lies not in the restoration of the body to its natural condition, but in a life of reason that is entirely free of the body. As Arazi says, the lower parts of the soul are given to us only to help keep us alive, so that we can keep trying to acquire knowledge. Ultimately, we should look forward, not to any bodily pleasure, but to the freedom from body we will enjoy in the afterlife. If Arazi cautions us to think about long-term pleasure rather than short-term pleasure, that is only a first stage of moral improvement in which we become better at least than irrational animals. The philosophical way of life is to go beyond this first stage and value only knowledge and justice. That of course fits with his theory of the five eternals, which as we saw, also speaks of the need for the soul to free itself from entanglement with the body. The teaching of the spiritual medicine also fits nicely with another, shorter work of Arazi on ethics, whose title is, none other than, The Philosophical Way of Life. Here Arazi responds to some unidentified detractors, who blamed him for refusing to lead the life of ascetic self-restraint. They said that he was failing to live up to the example of a philosopher he claims greatly to admire, Socrates. \"\\'We know,\\' said these critics, that Socrates was highly ascetic, lived out in the wilderness in a large wine jar, eating nothing but grass, and fearlessly speaking his mind to the hypocrites of his society. So why doesn\\'t Arazi do the same?\\' All this sounds familiar, but not from what we know of Socrates. Here the detail about the wine jug shows that Arazi\\'s critics have confused Socrates with Diogenes the Cynic, a common mistake in the Arabic tradition. Arazi accepts that this picture of Socrates is historically accurate, but then adds that it describes him as a young man, when enthusiasm for philosophy led him to utter disdain for the body. As he matured, Socrates relaxed into a life of moderation, such as Arazi himself leads. This is sufficient to demonstrate that one has achieved mastery of desire through reason, the goal also recommended in the spiritual life. Arazi was not the first writer in the Islamic world to valorize Socrates as a moral exemplar. He also appeared in his guise as a Cynic-style ascetic in the works of al-Kindi. Al-Kindi gathered a collection of reports and sayings attributed to Socrates, and this too assigns to Socrates ancient anecdotes that had once belonged to Diogenes. For instance, we are told how Socrates ordered a great king to stop blocking his sunlight. Like Diogenes, Socrates gets some good one-liners such as, \"\\'God gave man two ears, but only one tongue, so he would listen more than he talks.\\'\" Al-Kindi worked some of this Socratic material into a little treatise on ethics that itself offers a kind of spiritual medicine, specifically against the malady that is sorrow. This treatise, called On Dispelling Sorrows, quotes Socrates saying that he is never sad, because he has nothing whose loss he would regret. He is teased about living in a wine jar by someone who asks what he\\'d do if his jar broke, and he replies that he\\'ll still have somewhere to call home, since the place where the jar is won\\'t break. Al-Kindi also relays stories about Alexander the Great. On his deathbed, Alexander tells his distraught mother to invite to his funeral everyone who has never suffered misfortune. She does so, and no one shows up, teaching his mother that her loss is simply the universal condition of mankind. This material, which wraps its tough-love message in a pleasing package of memorable anecdotes, might seem philosophically lightweight. But just as Arazi\\'s spiritual medicine quietly upholds a set of values motivated by his theory of the five eternals, so Al-Kindi is basing his advice on the Platonist philosophy we know from his other works. He says right at the beginning of On Dispelling Sorrows that if we really want to be immune to sorrow, the only surefire method is to place no value whatsoever on things that can be destroyed. That goes not only for fancy soap and wine jars, but everything that exists in the physical world around us. Even the life and welfare of our loved ones, presumably, though Al-Kindi doesn\\'t dwell on that potentially disturbing implication of what he is saying. Instead, he recommends that we cherish things in the intelligible world, valuing eternal objects of knowledge, rather than the passing things of this life. Apart from this Platonist rationale though, Al-Kindi\\'s advice resonates strongly with Stoic authors like Epictetus. In fact, Al-Kindi also relates a parable found originally in Epictetus which compares life to a brief disembarkation during a journey by sea. Whoever is ready to race back to the boat without distraction or regret when the voyage home begins again, in other words when we die, will get the most pleasant seats on the ship of the afterlife. It\\'s possible that there is a link between Al-Kindi and Ar-Razi in the form of a student of Al-Kindi\\'s named Abu Zayd Al-Balhi. That last part of his name, Al-Balhi, simply means that he was from the city of Balkh in modern-day Afghanistan, just as the name Ar-Razi means someone from the Persian city of Rai. We know that our Ar-Razi studied with someone named Al-Balhi, but not whether it was this Al-Balhi. It\\'s chronologically possible, certainly. So it\\'s intriguing that the Abu Zayd Al-Balhi who studied with Al-Kindi produced a medical and ethical work that is highly reminiscent of Ar-Razi\\'s matched treatises on bodily and spiritual medicine. In the case of Al-Balhi, the two types of medicine are placed side by side in a single work. Here again, both sections are clearly influenced by Galen. The part on medicine for the soul deals with disorders like anger, sorrow again, and the pathological obsessive thinking that was known in Arabic by the rather wonderful word waswas. Like his master Al-Kindi and his possible student Ar-Razi, we find Al-Balhi giving a range of practical advice for combating these difficulties. He also emphasizes the link between the body and the soul, saying for instance that those obsessive thoughts can be the result of a buildup of yellow bile. On the other hand, they can also be caused by demons. This gives me a thought of my own. It reminds me of the battles against the literal demons of distraction waged by late ancient ascetics like Evagrius. Now Galen was not the only game in town when it came to Hellenic sources for writing about ethics in Arabic. There was also Aristotle. The ten books of his Nicomachean Ethics were translated into Arabic, with a bonus eleventh book of inauthentic material sandwiched in the middle. This extended disco version of Aristotle\\'s Ethics also had an impact on ethical writing in Arabic. Al-Farabi wrote a commentary on it, which is unfortunately lost, and later on so did Averroes. His commentary is also lost in Arabic but survives in Hebrew and Latin translations, which as we\\'ll see later is not atypical for his commentaries. Back in the 10th century, you\\'d expect Aristotle to have a particularly powerful influence on, well, Aristotelians, and as we saw, there was no more prominent Aristotelian in 10th century Baghdad than the Christian thinker Yahya ibn Addi. So it\\'s puzzling to turn to Ibn Addi and find him still working mostly within the Platonist ethical framework bequeathed to the Arabic-speaking world by Galen. Ibn Addi wrote a treatise called Taqdib al-Ahlak, usually translated as the refinement of character. The word Ahlak is also sometimes translated as character traits or even simply morals. Here again, we find the Platonic distinction of soul into reason, spirit, and desire, along with an insistence that ethical goodness is subduing the lower aspects of the soul to the judgments of reason. The reason that people become evil is simply that they give in to their animal nature. In fact, Ibn Addi rather pessimistically remarks that most people tend towards evil because human nature has so much of the animal in it. Obviously, he had never met my audience of podcast listeners. One striking aspect of Ibn Addi\\'s treatise is its remarkably flexible attitude towards morality. He allows that what is virtuous for one person might be evil if found in another. For instance, it is wrong for almost everyone to amass wealth ostentatiously, to conceal one\\'s ill will towards other people, or plot treachery against them. But all of these character traits are necessary for kings, who thus seem to be in a kind of special moral category. When reading passages like this, one can\\'t help wondering about the intended audience of the work. In fact, all the writers we\\'ve looked at, al-Kindi, his student al-Balhi, and al-Razi, include anecdotes or advice about virtuous kings in their ethical writings. That doesn\\'t by itself mean that all these works were directed at royalty, but we know that al-Kindi had connections to the Caliph\\'s family, and al-Razi\\'s spiritual medicine is explicitly dedicated to a powerful patron. One often gets the sense that our authors are at least aspiring to reach an aristocratic audience, a readership that itself aspires to be thought of as kingly. There is a genre of literary ethical works known as mirrors for princes, which can sometimes be philosophical, just think of Machiavelli, and our authors to some extent fall into that category. As a result, they often suggest that noble persons operate under rather special moral constraints. Al-Razi, for instance, states that a person raised as a prince cannot be expected to adopt the kind of ascetic lifestyle of a poorer person even if he devotes himself to philosophy. As we saw, al-Razi was in any case rather unimpressed by the idea of asceticism. Here Yahya ibn Adi is different, because he seems to take the radical ascetic as the ultimate ethical hero. He no doubt looks back to the Christian tradition of ascetics like Evagrius that we ourselves looked at in a previous episode. For most people, ibn Adi would recommend a life of moderation. But unlike al-Razi, he thinks that radical asceticism could be the right lifestyle for a select few and that these ascetics would be particularly admirable. This is clear not only from his remarks about ascetics in the refinement of character, but also from a fascinating little treatise he wrote on the subject of abstaining from sex. Muslims were frequently critical of celibacy. Al-Razi tends to agree with these critics on the basis that their recommended path to self-improvement would lead to the extinction of the human race if carried out on a universal scale. No sex means no children, and before long no children means no humanity. Confronting this problem, ibn Adi again says that asceticism is best, but not for everyone. Only those with a particularly powerful intellect should turn their backs on moderation with respect to sex and other pleasures and devote themselves wholly to the life of the mind. Since this will be a very small number of people, philosophically motivated celibacy won\\'t make a dent in the population. I\\'ll finish by looking at a final work with a familiar name, The Refinement of Character, by the Muslim Platonist philosopher and historian Miskawe, who lived well into the 11th century. He shares not only the title of ibn Adi\\'s ethical treatise, but many of the same ideas. Yet again, Miskawe emphasizes that reason should dominate the lower soul. He also would agree with ibn Adi that we can envision more than one ethical standard to pursue. We might want to live lives of worldly virtue, in which case we should adopt a life of moderation as recommended by Aristotle\\'s theory of the golden mean. Alternatively, we could pursue a life of pure intellectual contemplation, though Miskawe seems to think that this would not need to mean being a radical ascetic like the Christian heroes of ibn Adi. Both kinds of life would be lived in accordance with reason. To act moderately in the world does involve a concern with the body and not just the soul, but it still means letting one\\'s action be governed by rationality. That sounds pretty Aristotelian actually, and indeed of all the authors I\\'ve discussed, Miskawe is the one who does the most with Aristotle\\'s ethics. He clearly knows the Arabic translation of this work very well and refers to it often. On the other hand, he is still drawing on Galen, the indispensable source for Platonic ethics. The three-part soul is alive and well in Miskawe, as is the idea that ethics is a kind of medicine for the soul, as we saw in Ar-Razi and Al-Balhi. This is typical of Miskawe, who was not a particularly original philosopher but was extremely well read. His philosophical works tend to weave together themes from a wide range of sources, everything from Plotinus and Aristotle to Islamic religious proverbs. He thus represents a kind of cultured, popular understanding of philosophy that was current in the 10th and early 11th centuries. This was philosophy taken from Greek sources, freely mixed together with Islamic religious themes and displayed with literary style. It was a kind of philosophy that lacked the technical edge offered by sharper minds like Al-Farabi and Ibn Adi, but it might have endured as the dominant style of Hellenizing philosophy in the Islamic world, if not for a contemporary of Miskawe\\'s, Avicenna. We\\'ll be getting to him soon, but first I want to dwell a bit more on the context that led up to him. What sorts of philosophical options were there outside of the unblended Aristotelianism of the Baghdad school? We\\'ll find out by looking further at Miskawe and at other authors who sought to achieve a balance between the Hellenistic philosophical heritage and the teachings of Islam. I\\'d like to see the bar of soap that could manage that. So join me next time as we take a luxurious soak in the waters of Islamicized Platonism during the age of the Buyids, here on The History of Philosophy Without Any Gaps.',\n",
       "   \" Hi, I'm Peter Adamson and you're listening to the History of Philosophy Podcast brought to you with the support of King's College London, the LMU in Munich, and Riese's Peanut Butter Cups online at www.historyofphilosophy.net. Today's episode, Like Father, Like Son – Debating the Trinity. I don't know if you're familiar with Riese's peanut butter cups. They were nearly invented in the 19th century by George Washington Carver, who was credited with the idea of peanut butter itself. Amazingly, he stopped there, rather than taking the next natural step of coating a small puck of peanut butter in chocolate and wrapping the result in luridly orange plastic. As Dirk Gently said, it takes a genius to render the previously non-existent obvious, and in this case, the genius in question was H.B. Riese, who devised the peanut butter cup in 1928. When I was a kid, they were marketed with commercials that are emblazoned upon my memory. At a cinema, a boy is eating a chocolate bar and a girl is enjoying peanut butter straight from the jar, as one does at the movies. Both jump at the horror movie playing on screen with the result that the chocolate lands in the peanut butter. The result? Surprisingly delicious. They turn out to be, as the 1970s tagline put it, two tastes that taste great together. Why am I bothering you with this? This episode isn't really being brought to you by Hershey, the maker of Riese's peanut butter cups, though if they'd like to send me a year's supply in thanks for their free publicity, that wouldn't go amiss. Rather, my thinking is that debates over the Trinity were the Riese's peanut butter cup of medieval philosophy. Some have a taste for the rational inquiry of philosophy, others for their revelatory truth claims of religion. Many assume that the two don't mix, that they are like oil and vinegar. But they turn out to be more like chocolate and peanut butter, two tastes that taste great together. Anti-Christians were convinced that they could find evidence for God's Trinitarian nature in the Bible. Augustine's On the Trinity devotes several books to the scriptural basis of the doctrine, which is, of course, central to Christian theology. But Augustine goes on to show in his On the Trinity that the conceptual tools of philosophy can help us see how it is possible for one and the same substance to be three persons. The core of the Trinitarian dogma is the claim that the three divine persons differ from one another while being the same God. But what does this mean? A first thought might be that each thing is the same as itself and different from any other thing. This makes the Trinitarian doctrine look problematic. But further reflection will show that there are many ways of being the same or different. For instance, the Marx brothers were four things, so not the same as each other in every respect, but they were the same in respect of being human. The problem of universals, which we looked at a few episodes back, is really just the difficulty of how things are able to share this sort of sameness. Then there is the problem of sameness over time. Am I the same as the boy who watched those Reese's Peanut Butter Cup commercials? That boy was different in many ways. More hair, but less interest in philosophy, albeit that an enthusiasm for peanut butter cups has remained undiminished through the years. Or what about a thing and its parts? Is a peanut butter cup the same as its peanut butter center plus its chocolate coating? It may seem so, but consider that in that case anything that loses a part of itself would cease to be the same thing. Do I really make a peanut butter cup no longer the same thing by taking a bite out of it? Or make myself no longer the same thing by trimming my fingernails? As we can already see then, consideration of the Trinity leads directly to fundamental issues in metaphysics. The same is true for epistemology. While Christians did invoke passages in the Bible to support their Trinitarian doctrine, they were also tempted to think that human reasoning can establish God's triune nature without any help from revelation. Anselm already made a case for this in his Monologion. In the 12th century, a number of thinkers went so far as to say that pagan philosophers had reached an understanding of God's Trinity even before the time of Christ. Yet medieval thinkers frequently hastened to remind us that God lies beyond the grasp of reason. This might seem to apply especially to the mysterious, even paradoxical notion that he is somehow three despite being one and even simple. The Trinity duly became a kind of litmus test for how far medieval thought that reason can take us in understanding God. It was a test that Peter Abelard failed, according to Bernard of Clairvaux. When Bernard and his allies summoned Abelard to the city of Sainz to face trial in the year 1141, the accusations concerned his teaching on the Trinity. Bernard wrote to the Pope about Abelard, He is ready to give reasons for everything, even for those things which are above reason. Bernard had been alerted to the offensive nature of Abelard's teaching by William of Saint-Héry, who had compiled a list of his erroneous claims in theology. Abelard had differentiated the divine persons in terms of their distinctive properties, ascribing power especially to the Father, wisdom especially to the Son, and love especially to the Holy Spirit. William and Bernard took exception to the suggestion that the persons were not equal in respect of power and wisdom. For Bernard, Abelard also placed too little emphasis on the role of grace in human redemption. He seemed to suggest that Christ was merely an ethical example for us to follow. This goes well with Abelard's moral teaching and his claim that virtue involves forming the right intentions which lie wholly within our power. Unfortunately, at least in Bernard's opinion, it didn't go so well with Christianity. Abelard was coming dangerously close to Pelagianism, the heretical doctrine that humans can merit salvation without divine grace. Abelard refused to answer to his critics at Sainz, instead appealing to the Pope. But Bernard prevailed when the Pope took his side. Abelard was excommunicated, confined to a monastery, and forced to burn his writings on theology with his own hands. Eventually, Bernard and Abelard were reconciled, and the Pope lifted the excommunication, but the damage was done. Abelard later recalled the episode as a humiliation worse in some respects than his earlier castration. In the longer run, though, these events have done more harm to Bernard's reputation than to Abelard's. Historians of philosophy, like me, tend to see him as an anti-rationalist and pig-headed obscurantist, incapable of appreciating the subtlety of Abelard's superior mind. It doesn't help that Bernard evidently didn't bother to examine Abelard's works for himself, largely just following the accusations of William of Saint-Héry. Worse still, Bernard was a repeat offender. He went on to make accusations against another of the leading philosophers of the era, Gilbert of Poitiers, and succeeded in getting Gilbert to recant some of his theological claims. There's an important lesson here. If you want historians of philosophy to look kindly upon you, be kind to philosophers. But Bernard of Clavaux was far more than an anti-philosopher. It's appropriate that his preaching played a role in the launching of the Second Crusade in 1146, because he was nothing if not a crusader. He was a leading member of the reformist Cistercian order, distinguished by their white clothing and strict observance. The name Cistercian comes from the Latin name of the city of Citeau, where Bernard arrived in 1112 to join a community who followed the rule of Saint Benedict. He became a critic of other orders and communities, such as the one at Cluny, which was Abelard's first stop after his excommunication. He would spend the rest of his life there and at another Cluniac priory. The purpose of the austere Cistercian rule was of course to bring the monks closer to God. Bernard and his brethren were convinced that a rigorous, spiritual life could even provoke a direct vision of the divine, a mystical approach that contrasted sharply to the argument-based approach of the schoolmen. Bernard's devotion to monastic spirituality and his critique of Abelard and others for what he saw as vainglorious abuse of reason did not mean that he was wholly opposed to the intellectual tools provided by the secular liberal arts. The historian G. R. Evans has written that Bernard was Abelard had strayed into errors. Bernard and William of Saint-Hervie worried that those errors might be passed on to other, simpler believers who did not have the tools to diagnose where Abelard had gone wrong. Before we get too indignant on Abelard's behalf, we should also bear in mind that he attacked his own teacher, Roscelin, for, wait for it, an erroneous teaching on the Trinity. Following the account of names he found in classical works on grammar, Roscelin assumed that, if the divine persons have three different names, they must be not one but three things. Abelard attacked this assumption, turning against Roscelin his own strategy of distinguishing the level of words from the level of things. The persons cannot be different things, as Roscelin claimed. That would be to fall into the heresy of tritheism, a belief in three gods rather than one. Rather, Abelard argued, the persons differ in respect of their properties, like the father's power as opposed to the son's wisdom. Hence, the accusation Bernard leveled at Abelard that he failed to acknowledge the equality of the persons in respect of power and wisdom. But if God really is one and not three, how can he have different properties from himself? To deal with this question, Abelard developed a systematic account of how things are the same as and different from each other. He wasn't the first to do this. Aristotle and his followers had already distinguished between various sorts of sameness and difference. The most obvious way of being the same is to be numerically the same. For instance, you are numerically the same as yourself. This means that if we count, we find that there is only one thing here, whereas if we counted you and me, we would have two things, In other words, you and I are numerically distinct people. Yet, we are still the same in other respects. We are the same in form or in species, for instance, because we are both human. So far, so sensible. The problem is that in being a trinity, God is in some sense not identical with himself, despite being numerically one. That is, when we count how many gods there are, we had better come up with the answer only one. And yet, A tempting option might be to shrug and say, what can I tell you, the trinity is a mystery, so just believe it. But of course, that is not Abelard's approach. Instead, he points out that it actually happens all the time that two things are numerically the same, yet somehow different. Imagine that you are holding a peanut butter cup, and somehow resisting the urge to pop it into your mouth. How many things would be in your hand? The answer pretty clearly is one. Yet we could differentiate within this numerically one thing between the peanut butter cup on the one hand, and on the other hand, the peanut butter and chocolate from which it is made. After all, I can say things about the ingredients that are not true of the peanut butter cup. For example, I can say that the peanut butter and chocolate are what the cup is made of, whereas I cannot say that the cup is what the cup is made of. Unfortunately, God can't be exactly like a peanut butter cup, and not only because being omnipresent, he wouldn't fit into the orange wrapper. It's also because, despite being three persons, he is simple. He has no parts. Nor can he be distinguished into matter and form, the way a peanut butter cup can be distinguished into its succulent ingredients and the delightful shape that has been imposed on them. I particularly like those little ridges on the outside. Still, we have made a step towards understanding what must be going on with the Trinity by showing that a thing can be different from itself. This will especially be the case with the Trinity, because the persons are not, as Abelard puts it, mixed with one another, the way that the properties of physical things can be. A peanut butter cup is sweet and round, so sweetness and roundness are mixed together in it. This just means that the sweet thing is round and the round thing is sweet. The persons are not like this, because they actually exclude one another. The Father begets the Son and is not begotten, so the Father is not mixed with the Son. For this reason, Abelard is in a good position to insist that his account of the Trinity doesn't just reduce to calling one thing by three names. In this case, the difference in words really does express a difference in the thing. Ripping back from the details of this philosophical account of the Trinity, we should pause to notice that it is, indeed, just that—a philosophical account of the Trinity. Abelard was boldly carrying on Anselm of Canterbury's project of applying pure reason to fundamental precepts of Christian faith. It was a trend-setting move. Christians like William of Saint-Héry and Bernard of Clavo remarked with disquiet that, thanks to Abelard, there was a trend throughout France of engaging in rational disputation over the nature of the Holy Trinity. Supporters of Abelard stepped forward to denounce his critics in terms much harsher than those you'll find in any modern-day historian of philosophy. Abelard's student, Beringar of Poitiers, delighted in mentioning Bernard's youthful indiscretions and dismissed Bernard's major commentary on the biblical Song of Songs as derivative and badly written to boot. We also have a number of anonymous treatises preserved in manuscripts, which carry on Abelard's ideas in theology as well as logic. Other anonymous authors sought to reconcile Abelard's views with the ideas found in the other main contributors to the Trinity debate in the 12th century—the Victorines. If I may belabour the central metaphor of this episode just a bit more, the Victorines took a peanut-butter-cup approach to the cultural conflict between the secular teachings of the schoolmen and the rigorous monasticism of the Cistercians. Hugh of St. Victor was the H. B. Ries of the movement, immersed as he was in the liberal arts, while also being deeply committed to a life of spiritual devotion. When he turned his attention to the Trinity, he drew heavily on Augustine's On the Trinity. Augustine had discerned a threefold structure in human thought, insofar as the mind, its act of understanding, and its desire to understand can be distinguished from one another. Hugh points out that this same structure should appear in any rational being. Since God too is rational, we can thus extrapolate from our own Trinitarian nature to God's, without necessarily needing any scriptural revelation to point us in this direction. Given his carefully orthodox and Augustinian conclusions, to say nothing of his commitment to monastic reform, Hugh's rationalist approach to the Trinity provoked no hostility from Bernard of Creveaux. To the contrary, Hugh actually contacted Bernard well before William of Saint-Héry did, expressing his own worries about Avalard's teachings on various topics. Hugh's follower, Richard of St. Victor, set out a more daring exploration of the Trinity. He carried on Hugh's rationalist approach, going so far as to complain that he has nowhere been able to find sufficient proofs of this key Christian doctrine. He admits that humans are incapable of knowing God fully, but points out that, to some extent, humans are unknowable even to themselves. Somehow, we are single beings composed of two radically different things, a physical body and an immaterial soul. This fact too must remain mysterious, but it points the way towards a similar compatibility of unity and plurality in God. Richard proceeds by establishing God's unity and simplicity first, and then arguing that God is nonetheless three persons. Divine simplicity is secured by reaffirming a claim already made by Boethius. Whereas a human can be powerful or wise, God is his power and wisdom. Furthermore, these features are really identical to one another. Despite our use of several different words, in itself God's power is just the same thing as his wisdom. This could be taken as a quiet criticism of Abelard in that Richard is applying power and wisdom to God as a whole, rather than seeing these as properties that are specially appropriate to one or another divine person. As for the multiplicity of persons, Richard provides an innovative account that revolves around the idea of God's love. In line with Anselm's famous formula that God is that in which nothing greater can be conceived, we can say that God must bear the greatest possible love towards the most perfect object, namely himself. But as Gregory the Great observed, love is ideally directed not at oneself but at another person. So God must love someone else, and this someone else must be himself, since otherwise he would not be loving the most perfect object. So that gives us a God who is two persons. We're two-thirds of the way there. Richard next makes the assumption that in perfect love, a person not only loves someone else but also desires that they love a third person. Hence the need for the Holy Spirit. It provides the Father and Son someone that they can love jointly. Richard's assumption looks suspiciously convenient, and for all his stress on providing convincing arguments he doesn't really make a strong case for it. Why does true love entail wanting the beloved to love some third person? I think one might come to his aid by giving the example of raising children. I don't want to imply that any romantic alliance that lacks children is defective or imperfect, but there is something special and fulfilling in the way that the mutual love of two parents is inextricably bound up with their love for that child. Richard hastens to add that, given God's simplicity, the difference in persons does not amount to a difference in substance. That would lead to tritheism, the accusation Abelard threw at Roscelin. Richard avoids it by drawing a distinction between the being of a substance and what he calls its existence. He calls attention to the ex part of the Latin existere. In Latin, the preposition ex means from. In light of this, we should understand existence to refer not just to something's being, but to where it came from. In the case of the Father, we have a divine person who did not come from anywhere. He exists in and from himself. By contrast, the Son comes from, or is begotten by, the Father, while the Holy Spirit comes from the Father and Son jointly. Though the entire Godhead is a single substance, the three different ways of originating distinguish the persons from one another. Though Bernard of Clairvaux probably wouldn't care to admit it, Richard's account is not all that dissimilar from Abelard's, with the three types of existence in Richard essentially playing the role Abelard assigned to the special properties of the persons. The Victorines also shared Abelard's fundamental aim of using unaided reason to explain this theological doctrine. This is why Hugh of St. Victor, like Abelard, was inclined to admit that the pre-Christian philosophers had intimations of the Trinity. Pagan thinkers like Plato were pretty good at reasoning, after all, so it's only natural to expect that they would have gotten at the truth. That expectation seemed to be confirmed by the one Platonic dialogue known to the medievals, the Timaeus. There we find Plato describing a divine creator who looks to a kind of cosmic blueprint, the forms, which could be seen as playing the role of the second person of the Trinity, or God's wisdom. This creator furthermore fashions a force of life within the cosmos, a soul of the entire universe. For Abelard, this so-called world soul was analogous to the third person of the Trinity, the Holy Spirit. Despite accusations to the contrary, neither Abelard nor his closest followers went so far as to say that Plato had fully understood the Trinity, but others were not quite so cagey. In next week's episode, we'll turn to another group of 12th century philosophers who loved Plato, poetry, and peanut butter cups. Well, maybe not peanut butter cups, but unless you're trying to establish the doctrine of the Trinity, two out of three is not bad. Next time is the so-called School of Chartres, which included some of the most intriguing philosophers of the 12th century. The intrigue starts with the question of whether this supposed school even existed. So don't miss another taste of two more tastes that taste great together.
